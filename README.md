# BetterDiscordPLuginInstaller
Automatic Better Discord plugins installer - put the plugins in the same folder as .exe and it will install each plugin in the correct folder. 

I could make it connect to Better Discord's site and download selected plugins from there too but I don't particularly want to. I'll do that if anyone asks me to though.
